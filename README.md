# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
	The purpose of this election audit analysis was to pull various kinds of necessary information regarding the
election by using Python. The analysis walked through how to find the total number of votes cast, candidates who received
votes, the total number of votes the candidates received, the percentage of votes won, and the winner of the election
as well. The script opened and read csv files along with writing the final results in a separate text document located
inside a different folder of the project.

## Election-Audit Results
- There was a total of 369,711 votes cast in this congressional election
- Jefferson county had 38,855 votes
- Denver county had 306055 votes
- Arapahoe county 24801 had votes
- Jefferson county had the largest number of votes populating 82.78% of the total votes cast
- Charles Casper Stockham had 85,213 votes making up 23% of the total votes
- Diana DeGette had 272,892 votes making up 73.8% of the total votes
- Raymon Anthony Doane had 11,606 votes making up 3.1% of the total votes
- Diana DeGette won the election

## Election-Audit Summary
	The script could be modified to handle even more specific details for the data extracted from each county. This would
be able to show how each city inside the county contributed towards the vote count distribution and could allow the candidate
to focus more resources towards a city that is more likely to vote. Another modification to the script could be to take the 
data to a larger scale in order to have a bigger look at the picture for election. For an example, if we wanted to understand
the statistics behind red or blue states, it could grab states that would be dominantly blue and run the scripts on all the
counties in the states that are blue. This would require more data in the data file that would be read by the script. However,
these modifications would allow the script to handle more counties to take a look at multiple winning candidates and the
other modification would allow the consumer to understand finer details cased inside simple numbers displaying vote count and
the winning percentage.
